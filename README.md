# ewascome/nzbget-mp4_automator

[NZBGet](http://nzbget.net/) is a usenet downloader, written in C++ and designed with performance in mind to achieve maximum download speed by using very little system resources.

## Usage

```
docker create \
	--name nzbget \
	-p 6789:6789 \
	-e PUID=<UID> -e PGID=<GID> \
	-e TZ=<timezone> \
	-v </path/to/appdata>:/config \
	-v <path/to/downloads>:/downloads \
	ewascome/nzbget-mp4_automator
```

This container is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay. For shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it nzbget /bin/bash`.

You can choose between ,using tags, various branch versions of nzbget, no tag is required to remain on the main branch.

Add one of the tags,  if required,  to the linuxserver/nzbget line of the run/create command in the following format, linuxserver/nzbget:testing

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side.
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 6789` - NZBGet WebUI Port
* `-v /config` - NZBGet App data
* `-v /downloads` - location of downloads on disk
* `-e PGID` for for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` for timezone EG. Europe/London


### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application

Webui can be found at  `<your-ip>:6789` and the default login details (change ASAP) are

`login:nzbget, password:tegbzn6789`

To allow scheduling, from the webui set the time correction value in settings/logging.

To change umask settings.

You can add an additional mount point for intermediate unpacking folder with:-

`-v </path/to/intermedia_unpacking_folder>:/intermediate`

for example, and changing the setting for InterDir in the PATHS tab of settings to `/intermediate`
